            <p>
              Fostering is providing temporary care for pets who are not yet ready for adoption. 
              This could include puppies and kittens too young for adoption, pets recovering from 
              medical procedures, or animals who need socialization and training.

          <div className="faq-section">
            <h3>How long do I foster a pet?</h3>
            <p>
              Foster periods vary from a few days to several months, depending on the pet's needs. 
              We'll discuss the expected duration before you commit.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-section">
            <h3>What if I want to adopt my foster pet?</h3>
            <p>
              Foster parents often have first priority to adopt their foster pets. We encourage 
              foster-to-adopt arrangements when it's a good match.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-section">
            <h3>Do I need experience with pets?</h3>
            <p>
              While experience is helpful, it's not required. We provide training and support 
              for all foster parents, regardless of experience level.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-section">
            <h3>What if I can't continue fostering?</h3>
            <p>
              We understand that circumstances can change. We ask for as much notice as possible 
              so we can arrange alternative care for the pet.
